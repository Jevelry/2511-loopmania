Wednesday 12-2
Discussed basic plan for the timeline for Milestone 1
We discussed the specifics for epic and user stories Improve character; Facilitate character; Win game; Obstacles to winning
Discussed questions we had on what to include in the user stories next tutorial
Also discussed basic ideas on how we would implement the game with the ambiguities of the spec(example item degradation so prevent the character having all the equipment too early)

Sunday 7-8
Discussed what the plan was for completing Milestone 1
Clarified what would be included in the user stories
Discussed plans for the UI and gameplay mechanics
Elliot would write the UML diagram
Eddy making the wireframe
Kevin completing the UI
Hugo writing the timeline for milestone 1/2 and helping with UI and finish the stories
Set up discord to help with communication

Tuesday 2.30-3.30
Checked out Eddie's wireframes, discussed switching to bar health amount, including progress bar and level for weapons
Discussed the layout of the UML diagram and possibility of having multiple weapons "boxes" to signify a reliance on weapons
On opposite sides of the diagram.
Discussed whether weapons levels should be able to be changed at the shop but decided it would undermine the benefit of picking up
new weapons.
Possibility of including stats in the inventory and the menu, enemies killed and time played
Discussed mechanics of the trance allies difference to the barracks allies
Discussed how shop overlay would appear on the screen
Discussed how weapon level should appear on the overlay, whether it should be on the image; appear on the overlay when you hover the mouse over it; or if the specs should appear when you right click the shop.\
Discussed the possibility of the number of laps till you can open the shop, this will appear seperate to the number of laps counter
Discussed the movement of the mobs
Discussed how turning zombies works with allied soldiers
Discussed how the fight screen would look like in the UI

Thursday 7-8:10
Decided on final style for pause screen (displaying game mode and goals only when game is paused)
Discussed how to draw item level on UI. 2 ideas that we came up with is overlaying text over the picture or just having 10 seperate pictures. Elliot emailed Matthew to ask about thais
Added several interfaces to UML diagram (for weapon, armour and enemies). Kevin will take over from Elliot and make more changes before we submit
Hugo and Elliot will take over from Kevin and tweak assumption criterias, as well as add story points and priorities to each user story
Eddy is working on redesigning pause menu, relocating card inventory and adding levels to items
Plan to meet up again on Friday (at about 3) for a final check to make sure everything is working
Everyone is going to add assumptions, and then we'll add them all in a big dump to limit unnecessary commits
Hugo will finalise the schedule for Milestone 2 based off the priorities of User Stories

Friday 10-11
We realised acceptance criteria need to be a lot more specific (e.g. show amount of gold dropped by enemies)
Spent an hour deciding on health, damage, gold drops, experience drops and item scaling
Went through forum to figure out why player could place vampire castle and zombie pits
